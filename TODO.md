# TODO

## Activites

- On linking, recompute the weekly activites of the week containing the linked activity

## Settings

- Add a button to recompute the weekly metrics and daily metrics from the activities, planned sessions and settings.

## ANalytics

- Estimation of Threshold
- Estimation of time for a given distance  with ascend
- Get best activites in mSpeedEQ over duration and then get the speed law and critical speed curves equivalent to the power law and critical power. see docs
- Time in HR range (either custom or via Mips) for each week
- Ratio Funda vs Intense.
- Score of the race (with a betrail/ITRA/UTMB like )
-

## Activites analytics

- Compute automatic split ascend, flat and descent with metrics in each one of them, segment fusion easy in UI
- Similar activities for an activity -> recent similar activities.

## Dashboard

- Best runs in DistEQSpeed / Time
- BPM/Speed
- Metrics for each activities over time.
- Get Best up speed (SpeedEq, ascent speed in mean over with respect to the segment lenght) same for descent.

## Tools

- Pacing of a race with gpx / TCX / FIT : with values for each segment based on the values of recent segments in activities. (HR, Speed, Pace, etc. ascend, speedEq, etc.)
- In the future refine it with evaluation of previous load in the current activity.

## Small fix

- Open the card to be linked in the feed.
- Improve the UI of the planner -> less button, click on the card directly

## Plugins

- Add a plugin system to add new metrics and charts.
