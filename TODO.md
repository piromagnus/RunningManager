# TODO

## Activites

- On linking, recompute the weekly activites of the week containing the linked activity

## ANalytics

- Estimation of Threshold
- Estimation of time for a given distance  with ascend
- Get best activites in mSpeedEQ over duration and then get the speed law and critical speed curves equivalent to the power law and critical power. see docs
- Time in HR range (either custom or via Mips) for each week
- Ratio Funda vs Intense.
- Score of the race (with a betrail/ITRA/UTMB like )



## Interaval analysis
- Magnetic hysteresis : The path in the the HR-Speed plane is not the same for starting and stopping. The space between the two path can be seen as a sort of FC recup
- Memorise the shift between HR and Speed and look for a correlation with the fitness level.
- Try to keep only the interval part on the analysis.
- Create the 2 path curves for each interval

## Activites analytics

- Compute automatic split ascend, flat and descent with metrics in each one of them, segment fusion easy in UI -> store them and make comparison over time. 
- Similar activities for an activity -> recent similar activities.

## Dashboard

- Best runs in DistEQSpeed / Time
- BPM/Speed
- Metrics for each activities over time.
- Get Best up speed (SpeedEq, ascent speed in mean over with respect to the segment lenght) same for descent.

## Tools

- Pacing of a race with gpx / TCX / FIT : with values for each segment based on the values of recent segments in activities. (HR, Speed, Pace, etc. ascend, speedEq, etc.)
- In the future refine it with evaluation of previous load in the current activity.

## Pacing comparison
- Add expected time to spend to each aid station based.
- Compute the missing speed/speed-eq directly in the pacer tools and save it.
- Some errors between gpx expected and actual gpx but I don't think I can improve it much.

## Small fix

- Open the card to be linked in the feed.
- Improve the UI of the planner -> less button, click on the card directly

## Plugins

- Add a plugin system to add new metrics and charts.
