# ANalytics
- Estimation of Threshold
- Estimation of time for a given distance  with ascend
- Get best activites in mSpeedEQ over duration and then get the speed law and critical speed curves equivalent to the power law and critical power. see docs
- Time in HR range (either custom or via Mips) for each week
- Ratio Funda vs Intense.


# Activites analytics
- Compute automatic split ascend, flat and descent with metrics in each one of them, segment fusion easy in UI 
- 

# Dashboard
- Best runs in DistEQSpeed / Time
- BPM/Speed
- Metrics for each activities over time.
- Get Best up speed (SpeedEq, ascent speed in mean over with respect to the segment lenght) same for descent.



# Tools
- Pacing of a race with gpx / TCX / FIT
